# AeroHLG
Calculator for finding stresses on control surface linkages for 2020 aircraft.
The image uploaded demonstrates the control linkage to be analyzed (images provided by Ryley McConkey).
The MATLAB script can adapt to changes in the physical characteristics of the linkage or to the load applied since it uses matrix arithmetic (derived from 9 systems of equations).
